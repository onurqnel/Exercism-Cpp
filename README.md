## Installation

To run these exercises, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install G>

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onurqnel/Exercism-Cpp.git
cd Exercism-CPP
```

### Working Locally
 
To solve an exercise on your local machine, you first need to install and configure the Exercism Comm>
```Bash
exercism configure --token=<your-exercism-api-token>
```
 
```Bash
exercism download --exercise=<exercise-slug> --track=<track-slug>
```

### Solving the Exercise
 
The goal of each exercise is to create an implementation that passes all the tests. Each exercise con>
 - README.md: instructions explaining what is expected of you
 - HELP.md: information on how to run the tests and get help when you're stuck
 - HINTS.md (optional): hints to help solve the exercise
 - Test file(s): contain the tests that verify your solution's correctness
 - Stub file(s): provide a starting point to help you get started with building your implementation
 
### Submitting your Solution
 
Once your solution passes all the tests, you can submit your solution using the following command:
```Bash
exercism submit <implementation_file_paths>
````

### Other CLI Functionalities
 
- `completion`   - Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
- `configure`    - Configure the command-line client
- `download`     - Download an exercise
- `help`         - Help about any command
- `open`         - Open an exercise on the website
- `prepare`      - Prepare does setup for Exercism and its tracks
- `submit`       - Submit your solution to an exercise
- `test`         - Run the exercise's tests
- `troubleshoot` - Troubleshoot does a diagnostic self-check
- `upgrade`      - Upgrade to the latest version of the CLI
- `version`      - Version outputs the version of CLI
- `workspace`    - Print out the path to your Exercism workspace
